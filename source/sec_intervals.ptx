  <title>Intervals on the real line</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In what follows,
      we assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Set builder notation</em> is a way of describing sets of real numbers that satisfy some condition:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\{ x:</m> "some condition" <m>\}</m> describes the set of all real numbers for which the condition is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
      <m>\{ x : -2 \leq x \leq 5 \}</m> represents the set of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to <m>-2</m> and less than or equal to <m>5</m>.
      This set is often described using interval notation; see below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Interval Notation</em>.
      Intervals of numbers on the real line are denoted using brackets.
      Different types of brackets have different meanings.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\big[</m> and \big] are used to indicate that the endpoints of the interval are included.
            These correspond to <m>\leq</m> and <m>\geq</m> when the interval is described using inequalities.
            For example, <m>\big[ a, b \big] = \{ x:
            a\leq x\leq b\}</m> . Therefore <m>\big[ 0, 9 \big] = \{ x : 0 \leq x \leq 9 \}</m>.
            This set contains numbers such as 0, 4, <m>\pi</m> , 8.3759838459, <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>, 9, etc.
            There are infinitely many members of this set.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\big(</m> and \big) are used to indicate that the endpoints of the interval are <em>not</em> included.
            These correspond to <m>\lt</m> and <m>></m> when the interval is described using inequalities.
            For example, <m>\big( a, b \big) = \{ x:
            a \lt x \lt b\}</m> . Therefore,
            <m>\big( 2, 5 \big)</m> = <m>\{ x : 2 \ \textless \ x \ \textless\ 5 \}</m>.
            This set contains numbers such as 2.0000000001, 4, <m>\pi</m>,
            <m>\frac{7}{3}</m> etc.
            There are also infinitely many members of this set.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The two types of brackets discussed above can be used together.
            For example,
            <m>\big[ -3, 7 \big)</m> = <m>\{ x : -3 \leq x \ \textless \ 7 \}</m>.
            This set also has infinitely members,
            and in particular contains <m>-3</m> but not 7.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> Since infinity is not a real number,
            we must always use an open bracket for infinity or negative infinity. ex <m>\big ( -\infty , 4 \big ]</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Warning:</em> It is important to remember that not all real numbers are integers.
      For example, the set <m>\big [ 2, 3 \big ]</m> is <em>not</em>
      equal to <m>\big ( 1, 4 \big )</m> <mdash/> there are many numbers,
      such as <m>1.3</m>,
      that are in the interval <m>(1,4)</m> but are not in the interval <m>[2,3]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Combining intervals</em>.
      The set <m>\{x : 2 \ \textless \ x \ \textless \ 5 \mbox{ or } 6 \ \textless \ x \ \textless \ 9\}</m> is the set of all real numbers that are in the interval <m>(2,5)</m> <em>or</em>
      are in the interval <m>(6,9)</m>.
      We use the <m>\cup</m> symbol to signify the
      <term>union</term> of two sets.
      For example,
      <m>\{x : 2 \ \textless \ x \ \textless \ 5 \mbox{ or } 6 \ \textless \ x \ \textless \ 9\}=(2,5)\cup(6,10)</m>, and
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\{x : x\neq -4 \} = (-\infty,-4)\cup(-4,\infty)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally,
      if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two sets of real numbers then their
      <term>union</term>, denoted <m>A \cup B</m>,
      is the set of all numbers that are in <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, or both.
      Their <term>intersection</term>, denoted <m>A \cap B</m>,
      is the set of all numbers that are in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      <m>(-\infty, 2) \cap [-1, 5]</m> is the set of all real numbers <m>x</m> that are less than <m>2</m> <em>and</em>
      satisfy <m>-1\leq x \leq 5</m>.
      That is, <m>(-\infty, 2) \cap [-1,5]=[-1,2)</m>.
      Another way to think about this set is as the solution set to the
      <em>system of inequalities</em>
      (or <em>compound inequality</em>)
      <m>x \lt 2,\ \ x \geq -1,\ \ x \leq 5</m>.
